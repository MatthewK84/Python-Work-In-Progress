Python Machine Learning Models That Are Rough Drafts and In Progress
The models that are in this repository are rough drafts of some projects to continue my PyCaret, Tensor Flow, and Scikit-Learn machine learning journey. 

Thank you for coming to my GitHub and please stayed tuned as my ReadME files will be undergoing significant updates in December 2021 to explain all of my current projects in detail. Those details will incllude: 
1. Data Sources
2. Scholarly Literature
3. Code Commenting
4. Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering strategies.
